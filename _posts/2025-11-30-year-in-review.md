title:  "The year in review"
author: aosp devs
---

Just over one year ago in November 2024 aosp-devs.org launched with the mission
of creating a community for AOSP developers. Now is a good time to look back
and review what we have achieved and what we would like to do next.

<!--more-->

First, we have <https://aosp-devs.org>, which forms the focus for the group and
lays out our objectives. Probably the most significant thing we have created is
the aosp-devs [Discord server](https://discord.gg/hH59SPKYv8). This is one of
the few - possibly only - places where developers can come together to talk
about AOSP in a vendor neutral and developer focussed environment. As well as
the general channel, there are channels dedicated to HAL, kernel, SDK addons,
automotive and Android TV (atv).  There is a jobs channel which works for both
posting vacancies and to advertise that you are available for work. And, there
is an events channel with details of forthcoming meetups, conferences and
workshops. To date, there are over 600 developers signed up to aosp-devs
Discord, and in a typical month we see contributions from at least 50 different
people.

Another of our aims is to connect people through events. There are two strands
here: online events, via the The [AOSP and AAOS
Meetup](https://aospandaaos.github.io/), and in-person events at conferences.
Taking the first strand, there have been five meetups in 2025, with talks from
eight distinguished presenters on topics ranging from Mastering SELinux in
Android to the future of sideloading Android apps. All talks are [recorded and
published](https://aospandaaos.github.io/meetup.html). In the second strand,
members of the group met at:

* [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/aosp/), in Brussels,
* [Linaro Connect](https://www.linaro.org/connect/) in Lisbon,
* [OSS India](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-india/) in Mumbai,
* [OSS Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/archive/2025/open-source-summit-europe/) in Amsterdam,
* [IndiaFOSS](https://fossunited.org/indiafoss/2025/devrooms/aosp), in Bengaluru,
* [Droidcon Berlin](https://www.droidcon.com/events/droidcon-berlin-2025/) 

We will continue with both types of meetings into the future.

Every month we publish a [newsletter](https://aosp-devs.org/newsletter.html)
which keeps a track on the major issues in the AOSP world, summarises important
threads on Discord and lists upcoming events. The newsletter is a great way to
keep up.

We are also active on social media. See our
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aosp-devs/),
[Mastodon](https://androiddev.social/@aosp_devs) and
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@aosp-devs) accounts.

For the next 12 months, aosp-devs intends to continue the journey to create the
AOSP community that was lacking before. We want to keep the momentum and be the
place that connects AOSP and AAOS developers and fosters collaboration across
the open source community. We will continue organizing events, online and
offline, and spread news and knowledge about AOSP.


What does it cost to join aosp-devs? Nothing. Register on our Discord server,
follow our newsletter and connect with developers and us at the offline and
online events. See you there and let’s see what the next 12 months brings for
our community!
