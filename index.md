The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) is used globally to power devices of
all shapes and sizes, not just phones but also exercise bikes and oscilloscopes.
aosp-devs.org is here to help the people working with AOSP to create those devices

## Recent Updates

* [2025 April: What Recent Android Changes Mean for AOSP and Open Source](/blog-aosp-latest-release.html)

## Aims

* Reduce the fragmentation in the AOSP ecosystem by sharing code, tooling, and knowledge
* Provide a repository for documentation, tutorials, and best practices
* Provide a neutral place to host open source code outside of AOSP. A good example
  would be board support packages and other common patches
* Provide communication channels where developers can ask questions and collaborate
* Organise meetings on-line and in-person
* Provide education
* Provide a conduit between Google, the AOSP community, and OEMs
