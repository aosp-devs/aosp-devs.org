# aosp-devs.org June newsletter

Welcome to the sixth aosp-devs newsletter, keeping you up to date with things
happening in the AOSP developer community.

The tradition continues, again and again. The June newsletter is released two
days too late.

## Android 16 released

In June Google released Android 16. It's already available on the flagship
pixel devices and the source code on the AOSP git servers. You can find the
release notes here:
[Android 16 release notes](https://source.android.com/docs/whatsnew/android-16-release)

From a community and downstream perspective, the biggest news was the omission
of the pixel build targets in the AOSP tree. This caused some discussions and
will be covered by a separate blogpost that we will release later this week.

## Android 16 ports

It was fun to see how fast Android 16 was ported to the development boards. A
selection:

The paper [The Android Platform Security Model (2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05572) was shared on

The AOSP 16 release does not contain build targets for the current Pixel devices anymore. This
caused some [discussions on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1294292505419841678/1294292505927487510/1382619697635262514).
