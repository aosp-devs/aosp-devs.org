# aosp-devs.org November newsletter

Welcome to the eleventh aosp-devs newsletter, keeping you up to date with
things happening in the AOSP developer community.

New record: 6 days too late, but ... we are busy organizing the devroom at
FOSDEM'26.


## FOSDEM`26

aosp-devs will be again at FOSDEM 2026! This year we are joining forces with
the FOSS on Mobile devroom to host a range of presentations on AOSP,
Automotive, booting, as well as many other mobile topics.

The CfP is already over. The schedule will be published on December 15th here:

The QPR2 source code is out there. See the [building
