# aosp-devs.org April newsletter

Welcome to the fourth aosp-devs newsletter, keeping you up to date with things
happening in the AOSP developer community.

It may be becoming a tradition that the newsletter is released a bit later,
rather than at the end of the month. :-)


## New on LinkedIn

aosp-devs has a LinkedIn account now.  See
[aosp-devs](https://www.linkedin.com/company/aosp-devs/) and follow if you are interested.


## Updates to the AOSP development workflow by Google

Wondering if you are affected by the recent changes made by Google to the way
it develops AOSP?  We have published an explainer that (hopefully) makes everything clear:
[What Recent Android Changes Mean for AOSP and Open Source](https://aosp-devs.org/blog-aosp-latest-release)

For context, here is the announcement on source.android.com:
[source.android.com: FAQ - android-latest-release](https://source.android.com/docs/setup/about/faqs?hl=de#android-latest-release)

**TL;DR**: AOSP remains open source and releases should increase in frequency
