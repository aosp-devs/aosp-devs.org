# aosp-devs.org September newsletter

Welcome to the ninth aosp-devs newsletter, keeping you up to date with things
happening in the AOSP developer community. September started slowly, but
picked up speed with events and news to the end.

Nevertheless, the newsletter is late, late, late ... and late.


## Upcoming changes by Google for Application sideloading

We already covered the upcoming change
[A new layer of security for certified Android devices](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/elevating-android-security.html)
in the last newsletter.

There are some updates:

* From F-Droid: [F-Droid and Google's Developer Registration Decree](https://f-droid.org/2025/09/29/google-developer-registration-decree.html)
* From Google: [Let's talk security: Answering your top questions about Android developer verification](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html?m=1)

## Survey is online

This [survey](https://forms.gle/wXmnG5CvpfUGsL3b6) is to better understand how we,
the [people behind aosp-devs.org](https://aosp-devs.org/about.html), can
support the AOSP-Devs community.

Over the past year, the AOSP-Devs community was born and has grown into a
sizable group with monthly newsletters, meetups every two months, blogposts,
LinkedIn page, and a vibrant Discord channel.

The survey will help us learn how we can make the community even more useful
and valuable for you going forward. Please take a minute and fill it out. Thank
you.

In the light of the recent AOSP changes, people think about the long term impact on AOSP being used in custom devices.
