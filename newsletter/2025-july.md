# aosp-devs.org July newsletter

Welcome to the seventh aosp-devs newsletter, keeping you up to date with things
happening in the AOSP developer community.

It's already August and summer time in the northern hemisphere. So vacation
time for some people and therefore no excuse to release the newsletter on time.
Again it's two days too late. Enjoy.


## The libraries page

On the aosp-devs.org website we have a new page called:
[Library - The aosp-devs reference library](../reference.md). This is a list of
useful presentations, blogs, books, etc, organized by topic - just like a
library.

Have a look and we encourage you to add your own links and resources.


## In person event at the Open Source Summit India

Some late heads up for an in-person event at the
[Open Source Summit India](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-india/).
There will be a

organized by Sumit Semwal and Amit Pundir.


## New blog posts

On our own [blog](../blog.md) we have published a new blog post:

functional APK. Possible solutions:

Question about Voice Assistant integration in AOSP, but sadly without an answer:
[Message on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1294292505419841678/1294292505927487510/1396824186579583046)

Someone is trying to use libcamera for the camera HAL, but has some issues.
Some additional links: [mi89xx-mainline: mi8953_a: camera: Initial libcamera config](https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_xiaomi_mi89xx-mainline/+/441842)
and [mainline/common: optional: Add libcamera Camera Provider HAL](https://review.lineageos.org/c/LineageOS/android_device_mainline_common/+/439279)
Also nice, because the post showcases how to use APEX for HAL development:
