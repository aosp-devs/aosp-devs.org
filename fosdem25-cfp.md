We are pleased to announce this Call for Participation (CfP) for the
first Android Open Source Project devroom at FOSDEM 2025

FOSDEM 2025 will be over the weekend of the 1st and 2nd of February in
Brussels, Belgium.  FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised
by the community for the community.  The goal is to provide free and
open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software world
- be informed about the latest developments in the open source world
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by
  project leaders and committers
- to promote the development and benefits of free software and open
  source solutions
- Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers
  gratefully accept donations and sponsorship

## Format

The AOSP Devroom will be running on the morning of Saturday 1st February

We are looking for talks that are either:
* 10 min (short introduction of project/topic)
* 25 min (normal slot)

Note that we allow 5 minutes between talks to allow speakers to change over

Because we only have half a day we anticipate that at least 50% of the
time will be dedicated to short presentations

## Code of Conduct

We'd like to remind all speakers and attendees that all of the
presentations and discussions in our devroom are held under the
guidelines set in the [FOSDEM Code of
Conduct](https://fosdem.org/2025/practical/conduct/) and we expect
attendees, speakers, and volunteers to follow the CoC at all times

If you submit a proposal and it is accepted, you will be required to
confirm that you accept the FOSDEM CoC. If you have any questions about
the CoC or wish to have one of the devroom organizers review your
presentation slides or any other content for CoC compliance, please
email us and we will do our best to assist you

Thanks!
