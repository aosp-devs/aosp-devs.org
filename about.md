## Why aosp-devs?

There are many thousands of developers working with AOSP and yet they are
almost invisible: it's like the [Fermi Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)
but with software engineers. The aim of aosp-devs is to resolve that paradox by
bringing developers together and making them visible to each other and to the
wider community. We hope that aosp-devs will be useful to a broad range of
people working with the Android operating system and integrating it on varied
platforms. This includes components that interface directly with the hardware
such as the bootloader, the Linux kernel and the Android Hardware Abstraction
Layer.  It includes extensions to the native layer, to the system server and
even to the framework. And it includes the build system and tooling associated
with AOSP.

Our work is focused on the *open source* components of Android. We support and
promote the principles of open source community. Our mantra is: share,
encourage, educate, help.

## Who are we?

The idea for aosp-devs began with a talk at Linux Plumbers Conference in 2024
titled "The Search for an AOSP Developer Community"
 ([slides](https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1707/attachments/1538/3217/android-mc-community.pdf)),
 ([video](https://youtu.be/CTWQ-d7pj5s?t=2634)).
Following on from that a group of us decided to create *aosp-devs*.
The founding members are (in alphabetical order):

* Amit Pundir
* Bernhard (bero) Rosenkränzer
* Chris Simmonds
* David Brazdil
* Juhani Lehtimäki
* Karim Yaghmour
* Mattijs Korpershoek
* Mishaal Rahman
* Stefan Lengfeld
* Sumit Semwal
